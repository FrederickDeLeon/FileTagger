A C++ based application that allows users to assign multiple tags to their files and folders and search by those tags. The goal of the project is to provide a fast and flexible alternative to more traditional folder-based file systems.

Planned Features:

    Assign multiple tags to files and directories
    Search files by single or multiple tags
    AND / OR / NOT tag filtering
    Persistent storage
    Command-line interface
    More polished GUI (future)
